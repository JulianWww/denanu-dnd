For the duration, each friendly creature in the area (including you) has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.   Additionally, when an affected creature succeeds on a saving throw made against a spell or magical effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throws.",
