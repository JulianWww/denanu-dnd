On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction , if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn\u2019t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn\u2019t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.",
