Creatures that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are unaffected. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 14d6 psychic damage and is stunned. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn\u2019t stunned. If a target is killed by this damage, its head explodes, assuming it has one. A stunned target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the stunning effect ends.",
