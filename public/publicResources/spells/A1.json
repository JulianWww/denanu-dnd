	"description": "You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube.  You manipulate it in one of the following ways:  \u2022 You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn\u2019t have enough force to cause damage.  \u2022 You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.  \u2022 You change the water\u2019s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.  \u2022 You freeze the water, provided that there are no crea- tures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.",
