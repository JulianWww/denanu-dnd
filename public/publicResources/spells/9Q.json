Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn\u2019t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.  If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.",
