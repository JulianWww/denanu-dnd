Choose one of the following options for what appears:   \u2022  One beast of challenge rating 2 or lower  \u2022  Two beasts of challenge rating 1  or lower  \u2022  Four beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lower  \u2022  Eight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lower   Each beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.   The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don\u2019t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.  The DM has the creatures\u2019 statistics.",
