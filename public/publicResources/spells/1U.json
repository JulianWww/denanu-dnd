	"description": "You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range.  The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn\u2019t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.  Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target can\u2019t follow your command, the spell ends. ApproachThe target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you. DropThe target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn. FleeThe target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means. GrovelThe target falls prone and then ends its turn. HaltThe target doesn\u2019t move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.",
