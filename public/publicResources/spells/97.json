The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can\u2019t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.",
