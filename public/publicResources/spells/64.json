In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage on a hit. If the weapon isn\u2019t already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration. As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet ofyou must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn\u2019t blinded. At the end of each Ofits turns, a blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itselfon a success.",
